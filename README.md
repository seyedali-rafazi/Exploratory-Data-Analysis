# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project. EDA is a crucial step in data analysis that involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often with the help of statistical graphics and visualization tools. In this project, we explore and analyze a dataset to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.
